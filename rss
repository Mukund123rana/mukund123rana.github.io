					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve been freelancing as a journalist full time for two and a half years now, which feels great. I am occasionally exhausted, and sometimes miss the camaraderie of being on a team, but on the other hand I am no longer miserable. Pros and cons.&#160; There are all kinds of reasons I was unhappy working [&#8230;]]]></description>

I do have profound concerns with the ways the technology is being rolled out, sure, but I&#8217;m still an enthusiast at heart and I love playing around with this stuff.&#160; This week I wrote about a&#160;free transcription application&#160;that took a half-hour episode [&#8230;]]]></description>

If you don&#8217;t know what that means, I&#8217;m talking about the slow-loading colorful text box you&#8217;re seeing lately—it&#8217;s Google&#8217;s first step toward destroying the internet entirely (as I predicted last summer).

					<description><![CDATA[I have no idea how many people read my articles. I love it. This hasn&#8217;t always been true. When I worked at&#160;a culty tech company, I was forced to obsess over metrics. I was told I&#8217;m not data-driven enough, that I needed to improve. My manager set up a dashboard I was supposed to check [&#8230;]]]></description>

You can, if you want to, shut the fuck up. It turns out, when something big happens in the news, you don&#8217;t have to react to it. You are [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An open letter. You should make me the CEO of your company. I promise to upset your investors in ways that are really, really, funny. It&#8217;s okay to upset investors because they&#8217;re not people, just pools of money that long ago gave up on non-fiscal concerns like joy and human connection. You have their money—they [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I caught up on Star Trek: Picard. My main thought: What is the point of western civilization if even Star Trek can&#8217;t be hopeful? Star Trek was, at some point, about a future where humanity had overcome its issues. There is no longer any war on earth. There&#8217;s no scarcity and money is a thing [&#8230;]]]></description>
